Real-Time Chat Application Overview
This project is a complete, full-stack real-time chat application designed for instant communication. It uses the powerful MERN-adjacent stack of React for a smooth, single-page frontend interface and Node.js with Express for a fast, scalable backend server.

The core technology driving the instant experience is Socket.io. This library uses WebSockets to establish a persistent, two-way connection between the server and all connected clients. This means when a user sends a message, the server immediately broadcasts it to everyone elseâ€”no refreshing required.

Users can join the chat by entering a custom name. The application includes key features for a clean user experience (UX), such as automatic system notifications when users join or leave, clear message timestamps, and visual highlighting to distinguish your own messages from others.

It serves as an excellent reference for building any application requiring instant data synchronization.
